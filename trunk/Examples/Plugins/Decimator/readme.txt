Tobybear presents
Decimator
version 1.4 (VST Package update)

Another funky plugin from the Tobybear VST factory :-)
Nothing fancy though, a simple bit quantizer in a 
sample&hold unit to generate bit and sample rate 
reduction effects, followed by a lp/hp filter with
adjustable cutoff and resonance and controls for
output volume and wet/dry mix.

The parameters can be controlled via MIDI CC, here
are the assignments:
#70: rate
#71: bits
#72: cut
#73: res
#74: mix
#75: vol

What might make this interesting is that the full
source code for Delphi is included - everyone is
invited to take a look and use the algorithm.
And if you are not happy with the MIDI CCs, just
change them in the source code or add user definable
CCs.

The decimator algorithm will also be published soon
on www.musicdsp.org in C and Pascal syntax to make it
accessible to everyone :-)

Let me take this opportunity to tell all audio/DSP
developers they should really take a look at
www.musicdsp.org, it is a great site and does 
definitely deserve more attention!

That's all folks!

Cheers
